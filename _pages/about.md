I am a **first-year graduate student** at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/).
Besides, I also cross-register at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/).

**Currently**{: style="color: #990000; opacity: 0.80;" }, I am a research intern in the [Social and Language Technologies (SALT) lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), 
	[Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/), working with Prof.
	[Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html).
Also, I am a member of 
	[Visual Computing Group (VCG)](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at 
	Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the 
	[Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/), working with Prof. 
	[Hanspeter Pfister](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VWX-GMAAAAAJ&hl=en).
	
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the 
	[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I also minored in Computational Linguistics at the 
	[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. 
	[Hinrich Sch√ºtze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the 
	[Center for Information and Language Processing](https://schuetze.cis.lmu.de/), LMU.

**Research Interests**: I mainly focus on 
	**Deep Learning**{: style="color:blue; opacity: 0.80;" } & 
	**Natural Language Processing**{: style="color:blue; opacity: 0.80;" }.
