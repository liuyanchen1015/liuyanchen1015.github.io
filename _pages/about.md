I am a **first-year graduate student** at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) <img src="assets/img/h.png" alt="h" height="20px">.
<!-- , concurrently cross-registered at MIT <img src="assets/img/MIT.png" alt="mit" height="13px"> . -->

**Currently**{: style="color: #990000; opacity: 0.80;" }, I am a research intern in the [Social and Language Technologies (SALT) lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), 
	[Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) <img src="assets/img/Stanford.png" alt="s" height="19px"> , working with Prof.
	[Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html).
Also, I am a research assistant of 
	AI4LIFE Group at 
	Harvard SEAS, working with Prof. 
	[Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). 
	
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
	[TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/TUM.png" alt="tum" height="13px"> , with a minor in Computational Linguistics at 
	[LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/LMU.jpeg" alt="lmu" height="18px"> . During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. 
	[Hinrich Sch√ºtze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en) at the 
	Center for Information and Language Processing, LMU.
<!-- 	[Center for Information and Language Processing](https://schuetze.cis.lmu.de/), LMU. -->

My research interests lie in **Human-Centered NLP**, with a particular focus on: i) `dialect-inclusive NLP`; ii) `empowering CSS and linguistics with LLMs`; iii) `LLM agent & simulations` and iv) `trustworthy NLP`.
