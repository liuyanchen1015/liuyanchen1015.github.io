I am a **first-year graduate student in Data Science** at [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/).
Besides, I also cross-register at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) as a Computer Science student.

**<span style="color:990000">Currently</span>**, I am a research intern in the [Social and Language Technologies (SALT) lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), 
	[Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) at 
	[Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), working with Prof.
