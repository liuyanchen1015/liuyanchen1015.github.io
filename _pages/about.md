I am a **second-year master's student** at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) <img src="assets/img/h.png" alt="h" height="20px">. Currently, I am visiting the [Social and Language Technologies (SALT) lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), 
	[Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) <img src="assets/img/Stanford.png" alt="s" height="19px"> , collaborating with Prof.
	[Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html).
Also, I serve as a research assistant in the 
	AI4LIFE Group at 
	Harvard SEAS, working with Prof. 
	[Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). 
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
	[TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/TUM.png" alt="tum" height="13px"> , with a minor in Computational Linguistics at 
	[LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/LMU.jpeg" alt="lmu" height="18px"> . During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. 
	[Hinrich Schütze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en).

<!-- My research interests lie in **Human-Centered NLP**, with a particular focus on: i) `empowering linguistic and CSS research with LLMs`; ii) `multilingual and linguistic variations`; iii) `trustworthy NLP` and iv) `LLM agents and simulations`. -->
<!-- iii) `understanding LM's behaviors from linguistic lens` and iv) `empowering linguistic and CSS research with LLMs`. -->
