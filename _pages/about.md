Hi all! I am a 1st-year PhD student at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) <img src="assets/img/MIT.png" alt="mit" height="14px">. My research is generously supported by [MIT Michael Hammer Fellowship](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses/ses-funding/hammer-fellows/).

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) <img src="assets/img/h.png" alt="h" height="20px">, where I worked with Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
[TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/TUM.png" alt="tum" height="13px"> , with a minor in Computational Linguistics at 
[LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/) <img src="assets/img/LMU.jpeg" alt="lmu" height="18px"> , supervised by Prof. 
[Hinrich Schütze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en). Also, I had the opportunity to visit the 
[Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) <img src="assets/img/Stanford.png" alt="s" height="19px"> , collaborating with Prof.
[Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html) for one year.

My current research interests mainly lie in `LLM safety`<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13406">[1]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00915">[2]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14607">[3]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00138">[4]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09630">[5]</a>, e.g. the `safety of LM agents` <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00138">[4]</a>, `alignment`, and `scalable oversight`, as well as other issues related to `Human–AI Symbiosis` that we may face in the future.
