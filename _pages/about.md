My name is Yanchen Liu, in Chinese 刘延晨. I am a **first-year graduate student in Data Science** at [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/).
Besides, I also cross-register at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) as a Computer Science student.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/). I also minored in **Computational Linguistics** at the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/).

**Currently**, I am a research intern in the [Social and Language Technologies (SALT) lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html),
